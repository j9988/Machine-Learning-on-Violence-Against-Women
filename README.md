# Machine-Learning-on-Violence-Against-Women
## Introduction
<p>Violence against women and girls is one of the most widespread, persistent, and damaging human rights abuses in the world today, owing to the impunity, silence, 
  stigma, and shame that surrounds it (United Nations, n.d.). With the availability of data and the desire to reduce and prevent violence against women, data 
  science algorithms have begun to be used in this field. To predict violence against women, this study Logistic Regression model, Random Forest model and Artificial 
  Neural Network model were being used in this research. The research plan is divided into five major stages: data collection, data cleansing and feature selection, 
model training, and outcome evaluation and model deployment.</p>

## Data Acquisition 
- Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program dataset contributed by Andrew Maranh√£o who is a Senior Data Scientist at Hospital Albert Einstein, Brazil.

## DHS Dataset
  
### Issues in Dataset
- Data Contains Missing Value

### Data Cleansing
<p>Data is skewed in the box plot. The missing values need to be replaced using median instead of mean since the presence of numerous or a significant number of outlier data points indicates that the data is skewed in box plot. It is not advised to replace missing values with the mean in these circumstances since outlier data points will significantly affect the mean.</p>
